# Alignment Direction
Alignment direction is computed from setting-out alignment data for tunnel survey work such as tunnel segment plan, tunnel boring mechine (TBM), setting-out point at site etc. I created the coding to compute 3d-coordinate by known chainage &amp; offset and compute chainage &amp; offset by known 3d-coordinate. The coding was created 2 languages which're python and vba excel.

## Workflow
### Python
  1. Prepare Alignment data as [Import Alignment Direction Data.xlsx](https://github.com/suben-mk/Alignment-Direction-for-Metro-Line/blob/main/Python/Import%20Data/Import%20Alignment%20Direction%20Data.xlsx)
  2.
